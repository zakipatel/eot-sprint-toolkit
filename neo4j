<b>Idea</b>
- A tool to visualize/represent/understand/analyze EPA datasets using graph databases
- Something very similar to ICYJ Panama Papers tool for the #DataRefuge #DataRescue #GuerillaArchiving projects!


# How it Works
- Take as input the various <a href="#InputDataSources">lists</a> that folks are creating 
- Model this input as a graph database, using Neo4j
- Import  a Neo4j database 


Context
- People are creating lists of the data, and flagging for protection
- We want to set up this data and others as a graph database using Neo4j

Objectives
- Uncover structures
- environmental scientists to do analyses 


How to Use 
- Download the Neo4J database here 
- Requirements:
  - ..
  - ..
  - ..


Input Data Sources
- Gureilla Archiving Event in Toronto, Hackathon Group 1 : 
- <a href="http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge">PPEH Lab Data Refuge </a> : Gov Climate Datasets Archive
- https://nepis.epa.gov/EPA/html/pubs/pubtitle.html


Project involves:
- import data into a network graph
- connecting the EPA to other entities 
- documenting meta-data 




- We think there is value in creating a view of the EPA data that is out there. 
- Use the power of big data anlaysis



ICYJ Approach
- They extracted the metadata of documents using Apache Solr and Tika, 
- Then connected all the information together using the leaked databases, 
- Creating a graph of nodes and edges in Neo4j and 
- Made it accessible using Linkuriousâ€™ visualization application. 
 


track these interactions over time to observe how these datasets are changing, is the shape of the map changing? 

Give us the ability to:
check whether previous links are still active, and 
whether shifts in the network indicate which sections of the data are vulnerable.
track which data sets have already been archived. 
Help assess which data sets are vulnerable 
based on changes in the network 
and archival history.

When we rerun the script, we can track where our network is growing as the amount of data being archived increases,  
but also seeing where the data is disappearing or being deleted.
